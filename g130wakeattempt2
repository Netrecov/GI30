after attempt 1 failed, i thought more on it, and attempted to use a pi zero w, hosting a website, that would allow the user to press a button, then executing a python script, that could press the button, 
by shorting out the connections on the pcb, that are shorted when the button is pressed.

I havent lcoated a service manual or any techincal documents or schematics for the GI30.
I attempt to take off the front panel but after removing the screws, it was still held on, maybe with double sided tape. i stopped before i damamged the surface.

I moved onto the back panel, and after removing the screws, i see that i could access the internal electrics.
i had to disconnect the connector to the power supply, and where it loops back up to connect to the back pcb.
I also had to disconnect a smaller connector, maybe only 4-5 wires.
the antenna was permenant attached, and prevents full dissasembly.

Using my multimeter, while the unit was not connected to power, i tested the solder points on the back of the pcb, in the area of where the rotary button is located, and found 2 points that the circuit was closed when the button was pressed.
I soldered on a pair of wires, and ran them into the plastic shroud.
I then put the connectors back on, and secured the panel back in place.
I then remmoved the screws from the plastioc shroud, and removed that being careful as movement is limited by the length of wires running to the inner pcb.

I then routed the wire pair out the top side, and then secured the plastic panel back in place, i did not fully tighted the screws where the wires come out to prevent damage to the wires.

I then connected the wires to gpio 13 (pin 33) (thought it was gpio 23), and gnd of the pi zero, i worked through several iterations of python code, but failed to be able to close the circuit.

I attempted to use a npn transitor, and no luck.
I then removed the wired from the pi, and tried to use a relay.
nothing was working, (due to using an incorrect gpio pin out).
I was watching the connections on the relay with my multimeter in continuity mode, and i noticed when i flipped the leads, the unit would power on, and come out of standby, if i flipped them again, the unit would power off (weird).

"ok so i have the com connected to 5v, and NO on the relay connected to led, other leg of led 100ohm resistor then gnd
the relay does nothing when setting to high, then low
but if i take a wire from the NC side of the relay to the first leg of the led instead of the NO side, the led turns on"

i finally took it all apart, and used a breadboard with a led as the target of the relay, and through debugging found it to be incorrect knowledge of the gpio pin layout.
once this was corrected i was able to get the led to power on.

now it was time to move back to the speaker.
I waited for the unit to go into standby, and wanted to validate i hadnt broken anything, but connecting the wires again, and validating the unit would come out of sleep.
Nothing occured.
I orginally observed 3.3 volts between the wire pair, now its 2.4 volts. The button on the back has no effect when pressed.
the rest of the unit is still functional

Wiring:
Relay VCC → 5V (Pin 2 on the Raspberry Pi)
Relay GND → GND (Pin 6 on the Raspberry Pi)
Relay IN (Control Pin) → GPIO 13 (Pin 33 on the Raspberry Pi)

Relay Com → one of the wires in the pair
Relay NC → other one of the wires in the pair


script that works:
import subprocess
import time

# Function to close the relay (set GPIO to HIGH)
def close_relay():
    print("Closing relay...")
    subprocess.run(["sudo", "raspi-gpio", "set", "13", "dh"])  # Set GPIO 23 to HIGH (driving high)

# Function to open the relay (set GPIO to LOW)
def open_relay():
    print("Opening relay...")
    subprocess.run(["sudo", "raspi-gpio", "set", "13", "dl"])  # Set GPIO 23 to LOW (driving low)

# Example usage: Close and then open the relay
try:
    close_relay()  # Close the relay
    time.sleep(5)  # Wait for 5 seconds
    open_relay()   # Open the relay

finally:
    print("Relay control complete.")
